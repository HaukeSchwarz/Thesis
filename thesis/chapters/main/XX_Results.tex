\subsection{HMDA Data}\label{subsec:HMDA_EDA}

After all preparation steps detailed in \textbf{chapter \ref{subsec:HMDA_Data}}, the dataset contained \textit{851,936} observations and \textit{9} features (including the target variable, \textit{loan\_granted}). 

\textbf{EDA of the Target Variable}

The target variable, \textit{loan\_granted}, is binary (\textit{Granted} or \textit{Not Granted}) and imbalanced, with \textit{57.9\%} of all loans being granted. 
There were no missing values. The distribution of the target variable can be seen in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Target_Variable_Distribution}}.

    The target variable is imbalanced, with 57.9\% (493,290) of all loans being granted.
    \label{fig:CHXX_Target_Variable_Distribution}
\end{figure}

Analyzing the correlation of the target variable with the categorical and numerical features showed that the \textit{debt\_to\_income\_ratio} feature has the highest correlation (moderate negative correlation of \textbf{-0.61}) with the target variable, while the other features show only weak correlations. 
The correlation of the target variable with the numerical and categorical features can be seen in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Target_Correlation_Categorical}} and \textbf{figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Target_Correlation_Numerical}}, respectively.

    While there are only weak correlations between \textit{loan\_granted} and \textit{applicant\_race-1, loan\_type, lien\_status}, and \textit{applicant\_sex}, there is a moderate negative correlation of \textbf{-0.61} between \textit{loan\_granted} and \textit{debt\_to\_income\_ratio}.

% \subsection{Data Overview}\label{subsec:Data_Overview}

\textbf{EDA of the Features}

The processed dataset contained two \textit{numerical} features: \textbf{interest\_rate} and \textbf{loan\_to\_value\_ratio}.
% Their distributions can be seen in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Numerical_Distributions_1}} and \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Numerical_Distributions_2}}.
Their distributions can be seen in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Numerical_Distributions_2}}.
% Both are positively correlated with each other with a correlation coefficient of \textit{0.54}.

    \label{fig:CHXX_Numerical_Distributions_2}
\end{figure}

Exploratory data analysis of the categorical variables showed that the majority of loan applicants are \textbf{White} (65\%) and \textbf{Male} (85\%), resulting in 57\% of all applicants being both White and Male.
Most loans applied for are \textbf{Conventional} (82\%) and \textbf{First Lien} (86\%).
Aside from missingness in the \textit{debt\_to\_income\_ratio} feature, which alone accounts for 26\% of all values, the data in this feature are roughly normally distributed, with the mode being 14\% of values in the \textbf{36\%-41\%} range. 
The distributions of the categorical variables can be seen in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:HMDA_Categorical_Features_Distributions}}.

% \subsection{Fairness}\label{subsec:Fairness}

\textbf{EDA of Fairness Aspects}

Following the scope of this thesis specified in \textbf{chapter \ref{ch:Introduction}}, a special focus needs to be put  on fairness, specifically equality with regards to the protected attribute(s).
This potential unfairness in the underlying data can be identified from assessing the distribution of the target variable across different groups.
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:CHXX_Loan_Grant_By_Protected_Attribute}} shows the amount of (not) granted loans per race and by sex, the probabilities of being granted a loan across these groups can be found in \textbf{table \ref{tab:loan_granting}}.\@

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{CHXX_Loan_Grant_By_Protected_Attribute.png}
    \caption{Loan Grant by Protected Attribute}
    \caption*{Discrimination by race is apparent in the data, as the amount of granted loans differs significantly}
    \label{fig:CHXX_Loan_Grant_By_Protected_Attribute}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
      \begin{tabular}{lcc}
      \toprule
      \textbf{Applicant Race} & \textbf{Applicant Sex} & \textbf{Loan Granted (\%)} \\
      \midrule
      Black or African American & Male    & 46.4 \\
            & Female  & 44.1 \\
      White & Male    & 60.9 \\
            & Female  & 58.8 \\
      \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Loan Granting Statistics by Applicant Race and Sex}
      \caption*{Analyzing the differences in percentages of loans being granted among race and sex of applicants shows differences in the underlying data: Regardless of their gender, Black or African American applicants are less likely to be granted a loan than White applicants.}
    \label{tab:loan_granting}%
\end{table}%

Even though the focus of the analysis is on the \textit{applicant\_race-1} attribute, \textit{applicant\_sex} has been included as a second discriminating factor, as it also constitutes a protected attribute.
Inspection of the results depicted here did however imply that the issue of racial equality is more pronounced than that of inequality between the sexes.
A chi-squared test of independence proved that assumption of underlying inequality between races in the data, as the p-value is \textit{<0.01} and therefore H0 (equality in granted loans) could be rejected at any significance level.
Utilizing the aforementioned \textbf{AIF360} package to assess the mean difference of granted loans between the races in the underlying data amounted to a \textit{14.9\%} difference.

\subsection{Enrichment Data}\label{subsec:Enrichment_Data}

As stated before, analyzing the geographical information provided in the enrichment dataset (see \textbf{chapter \ref{subsec:Explainability}}) was expected to provide additional insights into the fairness of the model.
A sign of potential discrimination in the data could be the correlation between race and potentially favorable outcomes, such as a higher percentage of granted loans or a lower poverty rate.
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Scatter_White_Applicants_Loan_Grant}} shows a scatterplot that relates the percentage of White applicants to the percentage of granted loans per county. It indicates that a higher percentage of white applicants per county does not only seem to be correlated with a higher percentage of these loans actually being granted, but also with a lower poverty rate on average.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{images/CHXX_Perc_Grants_vs_Perc_White.png}
    \caption{Relationship between Applicant Race, Poverty Rate and Loan Grants}
    \caption*{Counties with predominantly White applicants do not only tend to have a lower poverty rate on average, but also see a higher percentage of loans being granted on average.}
    \label{fig:Scatter_White_Applicants_Loan_Grant}
\end{figure}

It should however be noted that the distributions within the enrichment data themselves are skewed by nature, as there are way higher numbers of White applicants in the data set and only few counties have a substantial number of predicted mortgage grants (see \textbf{figure \ref{fig:Enrichment_Data_EDA}}).

    Analyzing the enrichment data shows that while the percentage of predictions per county appears to be normally distributed, the distributions of the percentage of White applicants and the percentage of predicted granted loans per county are skewed.
