To increase the efficiency of the training process and to prevent overfitting, \textit{callbacks} for early stopping (with a patience of 5 iterations) and best model selection, both based on the validation loss, have been implemented. 
\textit{Adam} is chosen as the optimizer, due to the nature of the classification task, loss evaluation is based on \textit{binary crossentropy}, and \textit{accuracy} is selected as the target metric. Training takes place with a batch size of 48 and for a maximum of 30 epochs.

The model originally puts out numerical probabilities, which are then converted to binary values, using a threshold of 0.5.
Using these original probabilities, \textbf{ROC AUC} curves can be plotted and the ROC AUC score can be calculated, which is used as one of the assessment measures.
Additionally, a common set of classification metrics, being \textbf{accuracy}, \textbf{precision}, \textbf{recall}, and \textbf{F1 score}, are calculated alongside the \textbf{confusion matrix}.

\subsection{Iterations}\label{subsec:Iterations}

% Maybe more detail when decision has actually been made?
% Workflow idea: Training (unadjusted) -> Explainability -> Performance -> Fairness by using aequitas outcome (or checking AIF360) -> new technique by AIF 360 -> aim for similar performance but better fairness

Based on the results of the performance and fairness assessments for the initial model run (see \textbf{Chapter \ref{subsec:Iteration_I}}), adjustments to the model and the data preparation process will be made in multiple iterations, aiming to improve at least one of these aspects in each run.

As a first iteration, \textbf{Reweighing} will be applied. This procedure was initially developed by Calders et al. \parencite{Calders2009} and is implemented in the \textbf{AIF360} package. It works by adding a weight to each sample in the training data with the aim of balancing the weights of the different groups without actually adjusting any values.
The practical application of this technique includes the following steps: Initially, the weights of the samples need to be calculated. This can be achieved using the \textit{Reweighing} class of the \textit{aif360.algorithms.preprocessing} module. Being supplied with the training dataset and information on the privileged group (in this case, the \textit{White} applicants) and the unprivileged group (\textit{Black and African American} applicants), the algorithm calculates the weights for each sample. 
In order to ensure comparability of the results, an exact copy of the neural network described in \textbf{Figure \ref{tab:CH03_Model_Details}} is created and compiled. During fitting however, the weights calculated by the reweighing algorithm are passed to the \textit{sample\_weight} parameter of the model, causing keras to apply them during model fitting. The results of this iteration can be found in \textbf{Chapter \ref{subsec:Iteration_I}}.
